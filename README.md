# Separator app
This app takes a column and creates a *'you choose with'* separated list.


## Usecase
Write the separator you want to use (keep in mind that it also takes the space as value). Then write or paste the column you want to transform it into a row.
After the last input, press enter and then Command + D.

## Example:

Separator:
, (coma and space)

Input:
Life Love Dogs
A Town Called Parable
A World Away
Montauk Chronicles
All 4da Green
Ogre
Heaven's Messenger
Now Again
The Bat
The Earthing Move
Africa Screams


Output:
Life Love Dogs, A Town Called Parable, A World Away, Montauk Chronicles, All 4da Green, Ogre, Heaven's Messenger, Now Again, The Bat, The Earthing Move, Africa Screams


It works with different inputs:
Life Love Dogs;A Town Called Parable;A World Away;Montauk Chronicles;All 4da Green;Ogre;Heaven's Messenger;Now Again;The Bat;The Earthing Move;Africa Screams


## Why?
Imagine that you have a table where you need to copy the titles (each row one movie) to use them in an array. This is fast and works great. Not only that, it's blazzingly fast and there are less chances to induce human made errors.
